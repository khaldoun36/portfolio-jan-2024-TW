Unhappy with my current major, I decided to give coding a try and joined a Treehouse Swift programming online course. It was an eye-opener.

We barely knew what we were doing at the time 😅 and had to watch a ton of YouTube videos and spend our nights going through every Stack Overflow post related to TensorFlow and JavaScript. However, this experience was enough for me to fall in love with design and web development and pursue it as a career choice.",

During my time at Al-Tawar, I was also working as a freelancer on the side. Over the span of two years, I designed and built three websites: one for a personal trainer, one for a multinational oil and gas company, and one for a services company.",
